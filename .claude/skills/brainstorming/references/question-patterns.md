# Question Patterns for Brainstorming

Templates for asking effective questions during the brainstorming process. **One question at a time. Prefer multiple choice.**

## Scope Questions

> What's the **primary goal** of this feature?
> - A) [Most likely goal]
> - B) [Alternative goal]
> - C) [Minimal version]

> How much of this should we build **now vs later**?
> - A) Full implementation — we need all of it
> - B) Core only — defer the edges
> - C) Spike/prototype — validate the approach first

## Priority Questions

> Which of these matters **most** for this feature?
> - A) User experience (polish, flow)
> - B) Reliability (error handling, edge cases)
> - C) Speed of implementation (ship fast, iterate)

> If we could only pick **two**, which two?
> - A) [Option 1]
> - B) [Option 2]
> - C) [Option 3]

## Constraint Questions

> Are there **hard constraints** we need to respect?
> - A) Must work within existing [X] architecture
> - B) Must not break [Y] functionality
> - C) Must support [Z] platform/version
> - D) No hard constraints — greenfield

> What's the **error tolerance** here?
> - A) Must never fail (user-facing, data loss risk)
> - B) Can fail gracefully (show error, allow retry)
> - C) Best effort (log and continue)

## Trade-off Questions

> There's a trade-off between [X] and [Y]. Which do you prefer?
> - A) Favor [X] — because [reason]
> - B) Favor [Y] — because [reason]
> - C) Balance both — accept [compromise]

> We have two approaches:
> - A) [Approach 1] — Pro: [benefit]. Con: [cost].
> - B) [Approach 2] — Pro: [benefit]. Con: [cost].
> Which fits better?

## Open-Ended (Use Sparingly)

> What does **success** look like for this feature?
> Tell me about the **user journey** you're imagining.
> What **existing behavior** should this build on?

These are fine when you genuinely don't know enough to offer choices, but default to multiple choice whenever possible.
