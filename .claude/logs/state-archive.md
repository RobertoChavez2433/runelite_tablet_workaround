## February 2026

### Session 1 (2026-02-21)
**Work**: Initial project setup. Created .claude directory with full state management system.
**Decisions**: Adopted Field Guide App's state management pattern.
**Next**: Define project scope, research RuneLite. (Completed in Session 2)

### Session 2 (2026-02-21)
**Work**: Deep research phase for PRD. 8 agents researched auth flow, architecture, existing projects, Android approaches, GPU options. All research saved to `.claude/research/`. Brainstorming in progress — architecture approved, presenting design sections.
**Decisions**: Installer app approach (Termux+proot+RuneLite.jar). Auth via credential import (MVP) then native OAuth2 (Phase 2). Software rendering first, Zink GPU later.
**Next**: Continue design presentation (UX flow, components, phasing), write design doc. (Completed in Session 3)

### Session 3 (2026-02-21)
**Work**: Completed brainstorming. Presented and approved all remaining design sections (UX Flow, Component Details, Phasing, Error Handling, Testing). Wrote and committed design doc. Cleaned stale writing-plans skill reference from brainstorming SKILL.md.
**Decisions**: All design sections approved as presented. Removed nonexistent writing-plans skill reference.
**Next**: Create implementation plan, scaffold Android project, begin MVP development. (Implementation plan completed in Session 4)

### Session 4 (2026-02-22)
**Work**: Brainstormed MVP implementation plan. Reviewed research docs for feasibility. Chose vertical slices approach (5 slices, 23 tasks). Designed technical architecture (Termux RUN_COMMAND, project structure, bundled shell scripts, key libraries). Wrote and committed implementation plan.
**Decisions**: Full MVP plan, skip manual PoC, vertical slices, RUN_COMMAND intent, shell scripts in APK assets.
**Next**: Begin Slice 1 — scaffold project, Termux integration, shell scripts. (Design completed in Session 5)
