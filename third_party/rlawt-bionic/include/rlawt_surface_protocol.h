/*
 * rlawt-on-Surface wire protocol — shared between:
 *   - rlawt JVM-side native (third_party/rlawt-bionic/, runs in proot/Bionic JVM)
 *   - app-side RlawtSurfaceService native helper (runelite-tablet/, framework JVM)
 *
 * Topology:
 *   producer (rlawt JNI)  <---- AF_UNIX (SOCK_SEQPACKET) ---->  consumer (app service)
 *
 * Buffer transport:
 *   AHardwareBuffers are allocated by the consumer (it owns the pool lifetime).
 *   The native FD for each AHB is sent via SCM_RIGHTS as ancillary data on the
 *   POOL_BUFFER message that describes that buffer's index/format. Producer
 *   reconstructs the AHardwareBuffer with AHardwareBuffer_recvHandleFromUnixSocket
 *   and imports it as an EGLImage via eglGetNativeClientBufferANDROID +
 *   eglCreateImageKHR(EGL_NATIVE_BUFFER_ANDROID).
 *
 * Frame transport:
 *   Producer renders into the FBO-bound EGLImage of one AHB, calls swapBuffers,
 *   sends FRAME_READY{index, frame_seq}. Consumer queues the AHB to its
 *   SurfaceView producer via ANativeWindow_lock/unlockAndPost (for now we only
 *   need the AHB to land on the panel, not to be GPU-blitted by the consumer).
 *   Consumer sends RELEASE{index, frame_seq} when the buffer is free for re-use.
 *
 * Protocol is single-version-pinned; mismatched magic or version closes the
 * connection. All multi-byte fields are host-endian (both sides are aarch64-LE).
